# Build tensor networks

!!! warning

    Under construction [TODO: expand all these bulletpoints]

PlanqTN Studio provides the following building blocks to use to build
tensornetworks:

-   predefined legos
-   custom legos, that can be defined based on a parity check matrix
-   universal tensor network layouts

    -   CSS code Tanner layout
    -   General stabilzier code Tanner layout
    -   Measurement state preparation circuit layout

# The building block panel

TODO: expand on these

-   create a tensor network manually from smaller encoding tensors with
    predefined Pauli stabilizers (lib, studio)
-   create a custom lego based on parity check matrix (lib, studio)
