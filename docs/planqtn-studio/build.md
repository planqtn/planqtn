# Build tensor networks

!!! warning

    Under construction [TODO: expand all these bulletpoints]

PlanqTN Studio provides the following building blocks to use to build
tensornetworks:

-   predefined tensors (see the [Anatomy of a quantum LEGO] for what we mean by
    tensors)
-   custom legos, that can be defined based on a parity check matrix
-   universal tensor network layouts
    -   CSS code Tanner layout
    -   General stabilzier code Tanner layout
    -   Measurement state preparation circuit layout
