## Fusing LEGOs

To fuse LEGOs, select LEGOs and click "Fuse LEGOs" or press the (f) button.

## ZX-calculus transformations

-   fuse rule
    -   bialgebra and inverse bialgebra rule
    -   unfuse:
        -   pull out a leg of the same color
        -   unfuse to legs
        -   unfuse to two LEGOs
    -   change color by adding Hadamard LEGOs on legs

## Graph state transformations

`Z`-repetition code LEGOs are graph nodes that need to be connected through
links with a Hadamard LEGO on it.

-   create complete graph from nodes
-   connect nodes with a central node

## Visual transformations

-   "resize" groups of LEGOs - this is reposition based on the bounding box of
    selected LEGOs
