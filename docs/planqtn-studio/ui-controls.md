# UI Controls

## The Canvas

The canvas is an infinitely large space, that allows users to construct tensor
networks freely. It was designed to hold multiple tensor networks so that users
can create, clone, modify, analyze and compare multiple constructions on the
same workspace. On the top right the users will see the
[User menu](#the-user-menu), link to the [Documentation](#documentation) and
[Share the canvas](#sharing-the-canvas) buttons. The [Canvas menu](#canvas-menu)
and the [Panel toolbar](#panel-toolbar) are on the top left corner and the
canvas minimap is on the bottom right corner to facilitate
[Navigating the canvas](#navigating-the-canvas).

### Navigating the canvas

The canvas can grow large, and so navigation is facilitated by **zoom** - using
Ctrl + mouse wheel and **panning** with Alt + mousedrag. The collapsible minimap
shows the content in a gray rectangle, with a red rectangle showing the
currently selected part of the content.

The user menu allows for signing up and signing in via Github and Google
accounts, and signing out. See [FAQ](../faq.md) for what features require
authentication. Only the email address of the user is stored, no other
information is used from the accounts.

This menu also allows to investigate the monthly quota left for the user. See
[Cloud Runtimes](./runtimes.md/#free-planqtn-cloud-runtime) to understand how
quotas work.

## Building Blocks Panel

PlanqTN supports two types of building blocks, tensors and networks. They can be
accessed through the Building Blocks Panel accordion, Tensors on the top and
Networks on the bottom.

Tensors can be dragged from the Building Blocks Panel, to the canvas. See more
details on the supported legos in [Build tensor networks](./build.md).

Networks on the other hand are just simple buttons, and the generated network
will be placed around the origin of the canvas. See more details on the
supported parametrized tensor networks in [Build tensor networks](./build.md).

## Canvases Panel

The Canvases Panel let's you maintain the canvases in the local storage of your
browser. All the data you have is stored locally as of the first version of
PlanqTN.

You can delete a canvas by hitting the trash can icon, or by selecting multiple
ones and hitting the _Delete All_ button. You can create a new canvas by
clicking the New Canvas button. The Canvases panel can be activated from the
[Canvas Menu](#canvas-menu) or using the [Panel Toolbar](#panel-toolbar).
