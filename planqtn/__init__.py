"""The `planqtn` package.

PlanqTN is a library for creating and analyzing tensor network quantum error correction codes.
To build tensor network codes manually, use the [planqtn.tensor_network.TensorNetwork][] class and
the [planqtn.stabilizer_tensor_enumerator.StabilizerCodeTensorEnumerator][] class for nodes.

To build tensor network codes automatically, you can use classes in the [planqtn.networks][] module,
which contain universal tensor network layouts for stabilizer codes as well for specific codes.
